If you think I can be helpful to you or you would like to meet me, please feel free to reach out.\n\n# Some history\n\n- At 17, I started a [BSc in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.epfl.ch/education/bachelor/programs/mechanical-engineering/) at the EPFL. \n  \n- At 19, I spent a year in Germany at the [RWTH](https://www.rwth-aachen.de). I spent the year growing as an engineer, honing my German and discovering Northern Europe.\n\n- At 21, I started a [MSc in Robotics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) at the EPFL. Gearing myself more and more towards software, I made some cool projects with some even cooler people during my time there (some of which can be found [here](/projects))\n\n- At 22, I interned at Swisscom working on indoor localisation using the LTE network and deep learning. This led to [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07963). I liked it so much that I stayed with them to write my Master Thesis.\n\n- At 23, I wrote my Master Thesis at Swisscom -- on predictive machine learning -- under the supervision of Claudiu Musat.\n\n- At 24, I started my position as a machine learning engineer at [biped.ai](https://www.biped.ai), an early-stage startup building a device assisting visually-impaired people navigate their surroundings. I was responsible for the perception pipeline, and together we brought the product to market.\n\n \n# Things I like\n\n- Cycling\n- Multi-days hikes\n- Skiing\n- Comedy\n- Spicy food\n- Plants",l=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var t=Object.assign({},e);return Object(i.jsx)(r.b,Object(a.a)({},t))};t.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(c.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Arthur Gassner",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(r.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(i.jsx)(o.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
