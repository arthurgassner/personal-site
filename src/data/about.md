# Intro

I am a software engineer at [biped.ai](https://www.biped.ai) where we build a device assisting visually-impaired people navigate their surroundings. I like to build things, be it software, robots or relationships. If you think I can be helpful to you or you would like to meet me, please feel free to reach out.

# Some history

- At 17, I started a [BSc in Mechanical Engineering](https://www.epfl.ch/education/bachelor/programs/mechanical-engineering/) at the EPFL. 
  
- At 19, I spent a year in Germany at the [RWTH](https://www.rwth-aachen.de). I spent the year trying to hone my German (with some success) and riding through Europe on trains.

- At 21, I started a [MSc in Robotics](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/robotics/) at the EPFL. Gearing myself more and more towards software, I made some cool projects with some even cooler people during my time there (some of which can be found [here](/projects))

- At 22, I interned at Swisscom working on indoor localisation using the LTE network and deep learning. This led to [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07963). I liked it so much that I stayed with them to write my Master Thesis.
